## Get Started

Step 1 : Create the `.env` file.<br/>

```plaintext
REACT_APP_MAPBOX_API_KEY=Mapbox API key
```

Step 2 : Run `npm i` to install the packages.<br/>
Step 3 : Run `npm run start` to start the server.<br/>
Step 4 : A browser instance will be created with the server page.<br/>
Step 5 : Access any of the following routes.<br/>

- `auth` => /auth
- `map` => /map?apiKey={API_KEY}

Step 6 : Enjoy! âœŒ
